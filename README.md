# ML-Interview
This is a list of resources I found useful during my preparation for interviews. Broadly speaking, I interviewd for three different profiles: Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Scientist and Quantitative Researcher. 

NOTE: All these profiles usually include multiple "traditional" programming/algorithm rounds, and for that, I relied upon mild leetcoding spree, spread over a period of 3 months.

+ Sobel Operator [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
+ You have a fair Die, and you can choose to roll it up to 3 times. Whenever you decide to stop, the number thatâ€™s facing up is your score. What strategy would you choose to maximize your score? What is the expected score with your strategy? If you are given more than 3 chances, can you improve your score?
